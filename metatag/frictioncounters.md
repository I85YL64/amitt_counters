# metatechnique counters: friction

## by action


### D2 Deny
* C00006: Charge for social media (needs platform_admin:socialmedia)
* C00034: Create more friction at account creation (needs nan)
* C00035: Friction (needs nan)
* C00056: Get off social media (needs nan)
* C00097: Require use of verified identities to contribute to poll or comment (needs platform_algorithms)
* C00098: Revocation of "verified" (needs platform_admin)
* C00099: Strengthen verification methods (needs platform_algorithms)

### D3 Disrupt
* C00044: Keep people from posting to social media immediately (needs platform_algorithms)
* C00147: Make amplification of social media ports expire (e.g. can't like/ retweet after n days) (needs platform_algorithms)

### D4 Degrade
* C00089: Throttle number of forwards (needs nan)
* C00101: Create participant friction (needs platform_algorithms)
* C00102: Make repeat voting harder (needs platform_admin)
* C00141: "Hey this story is old" popup when messaging with old URL (needs platform_algorithms)
* C00142: "This has been disproved - do you want to forward it" (needs platform_algorithms)
