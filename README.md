Countermeasures for AMITT tactics and techniques (and some general counters too)

So we weren't planning to publicise this repo yet, but since we've mentioned it... 

This is the repo for the collection of potential disinformation countermeasures that was started at a Credibility Coalition Misinfosec Working Group seminar in November 2019.  A lot of people contributed ideas in the seminar, and it's taking us a while to work through, classify, label, dedupe etc them all.  

What you'll see in here is a [spreadsheet](GENERATING_CODE/CountersPlaybook_MASTER.xlsx).  In there are defences and mitigations for disinformation, categorised by disinformation technique, the resources needed for it etc.  There's also code to create lists of countermeasures by category.  So far, we have:

*  lists by tactic stage and technique (see https://github.com/misinfosecproject/amitt_framework for descriptions of these) in directory [tactics](tactics), with a clickable grid for this in [tactic_counts.md](tactic_counts.md) 
* lists by a higher-level label, "metatechnique",in directory [metatag](metatag), with a clickable grid for this in [metatag_counts.md](metatag_counts.md) (To be fair this is mostly so we can group and make sure we're getting the cleaning right.) 
* - we're also coding lists of what each type of person can do.

There's a report that goes with this too, where we're putting things that are too big for the spreadsheet.  That'll go into the repo when it's done too. 

THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS, so please pardon our dust: it's going to be changing a lot.
